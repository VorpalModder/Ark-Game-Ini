<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/7/7d/Ark_Survival_Evolved_Logo.png" width="120">

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a set of **ready-to-use, well‑organized, and commented `Game.ini` files** for ARK.  
This aims to:
- Set balanced stacks of item 
- Remove broken or unusable engrams (eg : radio)
- Reorder some engram to make leveling more intuitive (mainly grouping structure of the same material)
- Replace certain vanilla items with equivalents from selected mods when they are more relevant or functional. (eg: S+ structures)
- Improve the engram tab latency
- Offer clear visualisation of engrams by levels

## 🧩 Variants
- **Game.Vanilla.ini**  
  Only the base game engrams.
  
- **Game.Minimalist.ini**  
  Designed for **new players**, this version removes superfluous, confusing, or game breaking engrams that might overwhelm beginners.  
  It keeps the essentials and integrates useful modded items where appropriate, ensuring accessibility while still offering a rich gameplay experience.  
  The aim is to provide a clean, welcoming environment that encourages exploration without drowning players in unnecessary options.  

- **Game.Complete.ini** *(planned)*  
   Same as minimalist but with all items, even potentially game breaking ones.
